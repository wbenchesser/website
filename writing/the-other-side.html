            <p>The dead have never spoken with me.<br>
            I heard the silence, realized</p>
        
            <p>it’s the kind of joke that kills you, that makes you<br>
            swig salt water and wash your eyes out with soap.</p>
        
            <p>Ripples carry leaves of thought down<br>
            the river to when I was last alone.</p>
        
            <p>Ivy ties my ankles down–<br>
            The gift of leaving me here to wonder.</p>
        
            <p>Friendships turn to nothing when left<br>
            alone long enough to see the edges.</p>
        
            <p>I was boiling over with thought thought<br>
            thought about what did not matter.</p>
        
            <p>Then I thought I missed my mom. I think<br>
            I saw her crossing the other side of the hill.</p>
