          <h2>Welcome to my website.</h2>
          <p>In case you don't know me, I'm Ben. I'm working on my BS in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing at <a href="https://www.unc.edu">UNC Chapel Hill</a>. This summer, Iâ€™ll be heading to Austin, Texas to for a software engineering internship at Apple. I am currently a TA for the UNC Systems Fundamentals course (comp 211) and used be a TA for our Computer Organization course (comp 311). I am a <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/welcome">Computer Science Experience Labs</a> (CSXL) staff member and I'm gearing up to take over as manager in the Fall. Finally, I am the CEO of <a href="https://appteamcarolina.com">App Team Carolina</a> , a nonprofit student organization that primarily teaches mobile development and makes production-level apps including ones for other nonprofits like <a href="https://chapelhill.porchcommunities.org">PORCH</a> and startup apps like <a href="https://centible.app">Centible</a>.</p>        </section>

            <h2>Blog</h2>
            <p>Really, the point of this website is that I liked the idea of starting a blog. None of it is generative AI, I promise. As I write, I'll post and update here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="blogs/genAI.html">Generative Artificial Intelligence and Creative Fulfillment in CS - <i>4/1/25</i></a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Other Writing</h2>
            <p>Some of you may know I'm a creative writing minor. I don't know how, it's not like I mention it. If it's a poem, it may be a bit sappy or cringe, so be prepared for that. Here's some of my work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="writing/the-other-side.html">the other side of the hill</a></li>
            </ul>
